            <p>Satyendranath Dutta was the son of Rajaninath Dutta, who was a trader. He was born at Nimta, 24 Parganas (north). The family hailed from Chupi in Purba Bardhaman district on 11 February 1882.[2] His grandfather, Akshay Kumar Datta, was a great thinker, Brahmo social reformer and writer who was the guiding spirit of the Tattwabodhini Patrika. After passing the school-leaving examination from the Central Collegiate School, he received his graduate-level education from the General Assembly's Institution in Kolkata. Although he left (what is now) Scottish Church College without taking a degree, his training there helped him immensely for the future. After unsuccessfully joining the ranks of his father in their family business, he quit that to devote his energies entirely to scholarly pursuits. He wrote poems like Jatir Pati.</p>
